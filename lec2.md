# Introduction (continued)

## Programming Ground Rules
Includes 'clean code', modularity, meanigful names and purposeful comments among some other guidelines. For more information open [Ground Rules](file:///Users/robert.bonagura/Desktop/Software/213rules.htm) in live server to review guidelines

Javadoc - can autogenerate documentation when writing methods
    
    /**
    This is a concise summary of method.
    May contain more senteces to elaborate.
    @param paramname    comment on pararmater
    @return    return value is commented her
    */
    
* Comment block on top of each class.
* Each class gets its own java file.
* Use thoughtful names (variables, methods, classes).
* No magic numbers. 

# Object-Oriented Software Development
In traditional programming, the key abstraction is a function/process/procedure. In OO design, the key abstraction is the object itself. 

Class diagram are used to represent an object and it's relation to 
other objects.

## Characteristics of OOD
Objects are abstractions of real world entities, encapsulating data and
processes.
    
### Advantages of OOD
Reusability through inheritance.<br>
Extendability by creating new subclasses with new behaviors.<br>
Data hidden by exapsulation (Make data private, and only accessible with public methods).<br>
Easier to maintain (when using good design and modularity).
